Welcome to my vim config


Plugins:

vim-gitgutter - show git differences (added, removed, modified) in sign column 

treesitter - syntax highlighting





Some scape commands/notes I want to remember:

:Ex - explore (gets you out of file and back to directory tree)

"a" when adding a new file/dir to neo-tree

gg=G - formats entire file

:wqa - write and quit all

:h vim.lsp.buf - get info on lsp

:q! - force quit without saving

"+y - copies all highlighted code to system clipboard
